# One-Liner

This is just a project I worked on because I was bored. One-Liner is a programming language with a very simple syntax made in NodeJS. This programming language doesn't serve any actual purpose other than a cool side project.

# Requirements

`NodeJS` - Running the script<br>

# Running the script

Running code
```
$ node ./index.js [code]
```
